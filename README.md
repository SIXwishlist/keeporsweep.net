**Tech companies help you amass data ‚Äì we help you clean it**

Have fun while cleaning up your digital life


## How it works

Show _one_ random object at a time, from different sources:
- Files: pictures, notes, ‚Ä¶
- Mails
- Contacts
- Events
- Apps: uninstall, or mute notifications, remove startup programs
- text messages, Signal
- browser: tabs, bookmarks, extensions, Pocket, ‚Ä¶
- map markers
- Twitter: Tweets, favorites, follows, direct messages, authorized apps, ‚Ä¶
- Github: notifications, stars, repos, watched repos, follows, authorized apps, ‚Ä¶
- Youtube: subscriptions, favorites
- Steam: games, wishlist
- Meetup: groups
- expired Passbook passes
- people can add their own modules, like If This Then That
- ‚Ä¶

Swipe right to keep or swipe left to delete, tap to open. Deletions fill a counter. Possible further actions: favorite, share, etc.

Optionally limit to:
- Only things older than 3 months
- Don‚Äôt show already favorited things
- Archive instead of delete


## Implementation

- Possibly as app for: Desktop, Android, iOS, Nextcloud
- Terminal command to find random file: `find ~ -type f -print0 | shuf -zn1`
	- Expanded functionality in `random-declutter.sh` script
- In Nextcloud it could be done via: Write own controller, get the userFolder, do a search with a random letter on that, and then take a random result (be sure to check if it is a file)
- Maybe helpful for Twitter operations: [random-tweet](https://github.com/michaelbutler/random-tweet)

- Should have [nice animations](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
- Probably use a [card swipe JS library](https://github.com/gajus/swing)
