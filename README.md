# üíªüîÄüóëÔ∏è Keep or Sweep

**Tech companies help you amass data ‚Äì we help you clean it**

Have fun while decluttering your digital life, randomly!


## How it works

Show _one_ random object at a time, from different sources:
- Files: pictures, notes, ‚Ä¶
- Mails
- Contacts
- Events
- Apps: uninstall, or mute notifications, remove startup programs
- text messages, Signal
- browser: tabs, bookmarks, extensions, Pocket, ‚Ä¶
- map markers
- Twitter: Tweets, favorites, follows, direct messages, authorized apps, ‚Ä¶
- Github: notifications, stars, repos, watched repos, follows, authorized apps, ‚Ä¶
- Youtube: subscriptions, favorites
- Steam: games, wishlist
- Meetup: groups
- expired Passbook passes
- people can add their own modules, like If This Then That
- ‚Ä¶

Swipe right to keep or swipe left to delete, tap to open. Deletions fill a counter. Possible further actions: favorite, share, etc.

Optionally limit to:
- Only things older than 3 months
- Don‚Äôt show already favorited things
- Archive instead of delete


## Implementation

- Possibly as app for: Desktop, Android, iOS, Nextcloud
- Very basic prototype shell script at `keeporsweep.sh` (On macOS you need to [install coreutils](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/142860/install-shuf-on-os-x/142864) and then use gshuf)
- A [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) app is in the works at https://github.com/keeporsweep/keeporsweep
